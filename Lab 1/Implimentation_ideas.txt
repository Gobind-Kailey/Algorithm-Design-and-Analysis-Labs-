        1. Traverse through the binary string
        2. If the path does not exist then create the path by adding
            internal nodes until the end is reached and assign the leaf
            also known as the last value/symbol to binary. otherwise
            set the symbol value to null at each of the nodes. 
            
            If the path already exists then keep following down the path 
            until the end is reached. 

            Regardless of the path existing or not, we need to add the 
            final symbol = binary with the ci string name.

        3. As I am traversing through this string I also need to check 
            two cases: 
            1. Check if the prefix of something already exists, by checking 
            if there is something bigger that comes after a specific value. 

            For example : suppose we have 001 already built and now we are looking
            at 00, we will see that this already exists and the path is longer 
            than 00 and it goes to the right again with the 1. 

            2. The other case that could happen is the value is bigger, in that case
            we would just keep traversing and check if the value at the ends.
